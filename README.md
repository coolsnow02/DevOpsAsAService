DevOps as a Service, or DOaaS, it could be sub-set of offerings of IaaS . Like all members of the "as a Service" (aaS) family, DOaaS is based on the concept that the product, Service + Operation in this case, can be provided on demand to the user regardless of geographic or organizational separation of provider and consumer.
